The problems are taken from the Assignments given by <b>Professor Zhang</b> while teaching <b>Introduction to Machine Learning</b> at University of Illinois at Chicago.

The book which I used to study for this course is <b>Introduction to Machine Learning, Third Edition by Ethem Alpaydin</b>.

<b>Linear Regression</b>:
We can see implementation of Linear Regression using numpy in this Lab.
We can also see the effects of Learning Rate and Number of Iteration on the MSE.

<b>KNN</b>:
In this Lab we can see the implementation of KNN for Optical Character Recognition for the MNIST dataset.

<b>Cross Validation</b>:
In this Lab we can see the implementation of K-fold Cross Validation.
The below image shows the change in error rate with the change in number of folds(k value)
