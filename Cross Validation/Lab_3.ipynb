    "\n",
    "**Step 1.** The kNN classifier mainly consists of two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   During training, the classifier takes the training data and simply stores it.\n",

    "\n",
    "Cross validation is a technique in which we train our model using a subset of the available dataset and then evaluate using the complementary subset of the data. In this assignment, we use the $n$-fold cross validation method to perform cross validation. In $n$-fold cross validation, we evenly partition the dataset into $n$ mutually disjoint subsets (a.k.a. _folds_). We train an ML model on all but one subset (i.e., train on the union of $n-1$ folds), and then evaluate the model on the subset that was left out.  The former is called _training subset_, while the latter is called _validation subset_. This process is repeated $n$ times, with a different subset reserved for evaluation (and excluded from training) each time. If the size of the dataset is not exactly divisible by $n$, the remainder can be arbitrarily distributed into the folds.\n",

For all functions in `Lab_3.py`, copy the corresponding code snippets you have written into it, excluding the plot code.  **Do NOT** copy any code of plotting figures and do not import **matplotlib**.

Then zip up the **two files inside the `Lab_3` folder**.  **Do NOT zip up the folder `Lab_3`** because the auto-grader cannot search inside a folder. Submit this zip file to Gradescope under `Lab_3_Code`. \n",

You will see the results of running autograder once you submit your code. Please follow the error messages to debug.
