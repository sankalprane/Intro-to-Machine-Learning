    "## Problem 1: Implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) classifier **(65 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Problem 1, you will implement kNN from scratch, which is a good exercise to make sure that you fully understand the algorithm.\n",
    "Do not use any library such as scikit-learn that already has kNN implemented.\n",
    "But you can use general libraries for array and matrix operations such as numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1. (20 points)** The kNN classifier mainly consists of two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   During training, the classifier takes the training data and simply stores it.\n",
    "2.   During testing, kNN classifies every test example $x$ by \n",
    "\n",
    "> i) finding the $k$ training examples that are most similar to $x$;\n",
    "\n",
    "> ii) outputing the most common label among these $k$ examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the similarity between samples, we commonly compute the Euclidean distance. The Euclidean distance (a.k.a. $L_2$ distance) between two examples $p$ and $q$ in an $n$-dimensional space is defined as the square root of:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "(p_1-q_1)^2 + (p_2-q_2)^2 + ... + (p_n-q_n)^2. \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This term is equal to \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sum_i p_i^2 + \\sum_i q_i^2 - 2 \\sum_i p_i q_i. \\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With Euclidean distance, the smaller the value, the more similar the two examples are. Actually, there are many different ways to measure the similarity, such as cosine distance, Manhattan, Chebyshev, and Hamming distance. In practice, you can choose the one that suits your problem. For this lab, we will implement Equation (2) with a function `my_euclidean_dist` that  computes the Euclidean distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DO NOT use np.linalg.norm() or function from scipy.**  Make sure your implementation is generic, i.e., not hard coding the number of feature to 2, or the number of training example to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit test:** to unit test `my_euclidean_dist`, you can construct two matrices by yourself, e.g., `X_train` being 3-by-2 and `X_test` being 2-by-2. Then you can compute the squared Euclidean distances by hand, and compare it with the result of your code.  See the last four lines of the following code block, which lie outside the definition of `my_euclidean_dist`.  You can uncomment them for testing, but comment them back when you finish the entire lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "`euclidean_dist` will be called eventually by the `knn_predict` function in Step 3 below."

    "##2.1 Effect of different numbers of training examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**(35 points)** In the following code block, we will compute the classification error of the 1-NN ($k=1$) for the MNIST dataset by calling the `knn_predict` function. We will study does the error change with different number of training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks**: train on the **first** $ntr$ number of training examples in (Xtrain, ytrain) that is produced by the above data-loading code, where $ntr$ is varied in $\\{100, 1000, 2500, 5000, 7500, 10000\\}$.\n",
    "1. Print the test error rate for each of these values of $ntr$.  Note that the above data-loading code produces 10,000 test examples stored in (Xtest, ytest). Just use all of them for testing, i.e., fixing the test set size to 10000.\n",
    "2. Plot a figure where the $x$-axis is the above values of $ntr$, and the $y$-axis is the test error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Directly calling `knn_predict` with the training and test set may cost too much memory.  So we will classify the test examples in batches, i.e., divide the test set into `nbtaches` number of subsets/batches, and predict for the first batch, then second batch, etc. For example, with 30 test examples and 5 batches, we first use `knn_predict` to classify test examples 0...5, then 6...11, ..., and finally 26...29.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** you may refer [here](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html) for how to plot in python."

    "You're almost done! Take the following steps to finally submit your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After executing all commands and completing this notebook, save your `Lab_2.ipynb` as a PDF file, named as `X_Y_UIN.pdf`, where `X` is your first name, `Y` is your last name, and `UIN` is your UIN. Make sure that your PDF file includes all parts of your solution, including the plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "> * Print out all unit test case results before printing the notebook into a PDF.\n",
    "* If you use Colab, open this notebook in Chrome.  Then File -> Print -> set Destination to \"Save as PDF\".  If the web page freezes when printing, close Chrome and reopen the page. If Chrome doesn't work, try Firefox.\n",
    "* If you are working on your own computer, we recommend using the browser (not jupyter) for saving the PDF. For Chrome on a Mac, this is under *File->Print...->Open PDF in Preview*. When the PDF opens in Preview, you can use *Save...* to save it.\n",
    "* Sometimes, a figure that appears near the end of a page can get cut.  In this case, try to add some new lines in the preceding code block so that the figure is pushed to the beginning of the next page. Or insert some text blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Upload `X_Y_UIN.pdf` to Gradescope under `Lab_2_Written`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A template of `Lab_2.py` has been provided.  For all functions in `Lab_2.py`, copy the corresponding code snippets you have written into it, excluding the plot code.  **Do NOT** copy any code of plotting figures and do not import **matplotlib**.  This is because the auto-grader cannot work with plotting.  **Do NOT** change the function names.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Zip `Lab_2.py` and `Lab_2.ipynb` (**2 files**) into a zip file named `X_Y_UIN.zip`. Suppose the two files are in the folder `Lab_2`.  Then zip up the **two files inside the `Lab_2` folder**.  **Do NOT zip up the folder `Lab_2`** because the auto-grader cannot search inside a folder. Submit this zip file to Gradescope under `Lab_2_Code`. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. The autograder on Gradscope will be open all the time. We designed some simple test cases to help you check wehther your functions are executable. You will see the results of running autograder once you submit your code. Please follow the error messages to debug. Since those simple test cases are designed for debugging, it does not guaranttee your solution will work well on the real dataset. It is your responsibility to make your code logically correct. Since all functions are tested in batch, the autograder might take a few minutes to run after submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you *only* try to get real-time feedback from auto-grader, it will be fine to just upload `Lab_2.py` to `Lab_2_Code`.  However, the final submission for grading should still follow the above point 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can submit to Gradescope as often as you like. We will only consider your last submission before the deadline."
